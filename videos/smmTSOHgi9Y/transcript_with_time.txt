0.43s: [Music]
0.80s: so one thing that I find a lot of
2.04s: creators face when it comes to sitting
3.40s: down and filming their lives especially
5.00s: beginners is the lack of general
6.40s: direction for myself recently I've been
7.92s: doing a lot more thinking into my own
9.64s: creative process because right now I'm
11.40s: in school I'm in University so it's
12.96s: really more important than ever for me
14.28s: to have my time management down so I can
15.88s: really make time for what I want to do
17.64s: so today that's what I wanted to talk
18.88s: about I wanted to show you guys how I go
20.40s: through and make these videos how I'm
21.68s: able to live my life go through
23.16s: full-time school and hopefully by the
24.72s: end of this video you guys will have a
26.04s: good sense of how I make these videos
27.40s: and implement it into your own videos
38.84s: so what are you supposed to film what
39.72s: are you supposed to say what is the
40.84s: general idea and topic of your videos I
42.92s: found that the easy answer to that
44.20s: question is just film your life bring
45.80s: your camera with you on your day and
47.32s: film whatever you get up to and that
48.68s: does work that's what a lot of videos
49.96s: and Vlogs on this platform are but
51.72s: here's how I try and think of my Vlogs
53.64s: test so I've said this before but I try
55.76s: and think of my videos as a journal a
57.64s: place that I can showcase and talk about
59.20s: what I'm up to in my life life but also
60.60s: how I feel so what that means for me is
62.24s: that these Vlogs are really a place for
63.40s: reflection don't just show me what
64.84s: you're up to in your day tell me how you
66.60s: feel tell me what you did and how that
67.88s: made you feel so me personally I usually
69.52s: don't scrip my videos aside from videos
71.12s: like this where I have very specific
72.64s: talking points I need to hit but I will
74.04s: always ensure that no matter what the
75.28s: video is it has a central topic or theme
77.48s: and that idea can literally be anything
79.48s: it could be a song a feeling a product a
81.92s: trip an emotion I truly think that
83.68s: anything can be turned into a story in
85.40s: the form of a vlog so things that you
86.72s: should think about before you come up
87.88s: with an idea who are you what's your
89.52s: background and what are you trying to do
91.52s: a lot of the time even now I'm going to
93.16s: be honest it feels like I'm going out
94.68s: and just filming Random clips and trying
96.12s: to string them together in the edit but
97.64s: something that I understand now more
98.84s: than I did in the beginning is that even
100.92s: if there is no string to tie your entire
102.92s: video together they're still you the
104.56s: person recording it it's your Vlog so
106.84s: you are that string tying all the clips
108.88s: together so now when I sit down and make
110.12s: these videos I try and lean into that a
111.68s: lot more I try and lean into the
112.96s: emotions that I was feeling when I was
114.36s: out shooting that video and try and
116.00s: really recreate that in the edit just
117.84s: remember that everyone in life is on
119.20s: their own Journey so just try and take
120.68s: your camera your audience on whatever
122.48s: Journey that you're
123.90s: [Music]
128.52s: on when I first picked up a camera I did
131.00s: think that the best camera was going to
132.28s: make me the best videographer the best
133.80s: filmmaker the best YouTuber but chances
135.88s: are for all of us if I handed you A10
137.84s: $220,000 camera right now we both
140.24s: probably wouldn't be able to use it and
141.48s: it would probably actually complicate
142.60s: things so much that we would either give
144.16s: up not have a video or just make a worse
146.36s: quality video than if we just used what
147.80s: we knew how to use it's actually super
149.20s: important that you use the camera the
150.48s: tools that you're familiar with that
151.76s: you're comfortable with that can
153.00s: actually get you from point A to point B
155.04s: your goals so I basically exclusively
157.24s: shoot all of my videos on my Sony a6700
159.92s: I also have a drone and a 360 camera but
161.64s: those are like Niche cameras for
163.16s: everyday filming talking cinematic stuff
165.12s: this is the angle that you guys see and
166.60s: I pair that with two lenses my 11 mm
168.56s: wide angle for talking and 17 to 70 zoom
170.84s: lens for whenever I need a little bit
172.32s: more reach this is what the entire setup
173.96s: looks like and I use it mainly because
175.60s: the colors and quality is amazing but
177.60s: really it's about the convenience for me
178.96s: this is the camera that I know how to
180.28s: use and it's also compact enough that I
182.00s: actually bring it out with me and it's
183.16s: not intrusive to my daily life but my
184.80s: point right now is that if you want to
185.80s: make videos about your life and carry a
187.12s: camera with you it's going to have to be
188.56s: Compact and small enough and convenient
190.36s: enough that you'll actually use
193.13s: [Music]
205.32s: it so when it comes down to actually
207.36s: filming there's really two things that I
208.88s: like to do there's film a roll which is
210.56s: like this where I'm actually talking to
211.72s: you guys and then there's b roll which
213.28s: is just overlaid on top maybe with some
215.08s: music a little slow motion things that
216.80s: help progress the story that aren't just
218.20s: me talking to you guys and this is how I
219.72s: do both to craft my videos so recently
221.68s: I've been using the ulanzi TT 38 tripod
224.40s: and the reason that it's important to
225.52s: have a tripod like this is because when
227.40s: you're out shooting by yourself you're
228.56s: going to have to get a lot of different
230.36s: shots sometimes when you're filming the
232.08s: a roll you'll need to hold the camera in
233.40s: your hand and usually you want to get a
234.84s: little bit of distance between yourself
236.12s: and the camera so you're not just
237.24s: showing your face but also your
238.56s: surroundings so in those cases that's
240.36s: where I use this in handheld
242.76s: mode and then for other shots like right
245.08s: now where you guys are sitting on my
246.24s: desk it's also super important to be
247.64s: able to set up these kind of static
249.04s: shots whether I'm behind the camera or
250.80s: in front of the camera it feels good to
252.04s: know that your camera is
254.08s: secure for myself when it comes to
256.00s: shooting it really is all about
257.56s: convenience and I'll show you what I
258.96s: mean so instead of individually folding
260.84s: out each leg now with one click of a
262.64s: button the entire mechanism unfolds and
264.64s: the same logic applies for the fact that
266.04s: the entire thing is a quick release
267.44s: system so with a quick lock or unlock I
269.12s: can quickly take take off my camera or
270.76s: put it back on so I can get right to
272.32s: shooting anything that I own that can
274.08s: increase my productivity and efficiency
275.68s: when I'm shooting is exactly the kind of
277.00s: thing that you're going to want when
277.84s: you're out shooting your life which if
279.28s: you guys have noticed is kind of the
280.68s: entire theme around this entire video
282.36s: and when I'm all done talking I can
283.64s: literally just pack up and leave so
285.32s: being able to quickly set up these shots
286.68s: and capture exactly what I'm looking for
288.36s: is what this tripod is all about it also
290.24s: has this hook on the back which my last
291.48s: tripod did not but now any overhanging
293.48s: surface can allow me to mount my tripod
295.16s: to it so now I've got angles like
299.92s: ah pretty cool stuff super important to
301.88s: have the right tool that actually
303.08s: contributes without taking away and over
304.92s: complicating your process so if you want
306.56s: to check out the TT 38 tripod I'll have
308.56s: it linked in the
313.96s: description because of my creative style
316.08s: and the type of videos that I like to
317.40s: make I really just find that I need to
318.60s: film a lot I'll definitely remind myself
320.12s: to try and capture shots in between
321.56s: scenes and once or twice a week I'll go
323.40s: out and maybe shoot the sunset or shoot
325.12s: the park or just general establishing
327.12s: shots I would much rather capture too
328.96s: much footage than not have enough to
330.36s: tell the story and I think what's helped
332.12s: me a lot is just consciously remembering
334.12s: to bring my camera because the worst
335.36s: feeling is really going out not having
337.00s: your camera and thinking to yourself how
338.72s: nice it would have been to capture that
339.94s: [Music]
345.84s: moment so after a day a week or a few
348.40s: days of shooting when I get home the
350.04s: first thing I do is dump all that
351.40s: footage onto my computer and just like
353.04s: anything else in this entire creative
354.52s: process editing is also incredibly
356.48s: subjective the way I do things does not
358.24s: have to be how you go do things and also
360.08s: I can tell you right now the way I do
361.40s: things is definitely not the
362.48s: scientifically proven correct way to do
364.36s: things in the past I've already made a
365.68s: video about color grading but I
367.36s: definitely want to update that soon but
369.08s: for this section right now I'm not going
370.28s: to dive into technical details I'm more
371.88s: just going to talk about how I think
373.12s: about organizing my footage and chopping
374.76s: it up instead of the actual sliders and
376.68s: tools and things and buttons I'm
378.28s: clicking so when it comes to chopping up
379.84s: a video a lot of times people will do
381.20s: the simple thing which is just chop from
382.84s: chronological order morning to night
384.52s: time and that totally works I personally
386.20s: found myself experimenting with kind of
388.32s: placing together footage as scenes as I
390.44s: call them uh in different orders and
392.48s: these scenes are any like period of time
394.44s: where I'm picking up the camera let's
395.72s: say in one of my previous videos I go to
397.84s: an ultimate frisbee game and I film that
399.84s: that would be one scene me getting ready
401.84s: changed and walking to the field would
404.00s: probably be the start of the scene and
405.36s: the game end or walking home would
406.80s: probably be the end of the scene and
408.12s: then there'd be some sort of transition
409.40s: maybe I would use some sort of b-roll
410.72s: that I was talking about earlier so once
412.08s: I've gone through and chopped up all of
413.44s: my original raw footage and yes I do
415.48s: actually look at all of my original
416.96s: footage every second of it once I have
418.84s: that set in front of me I will go and
420.40s: take the scenes and move them around and
422.76s: create the best story that I can if
424.52s: whatever theme or emotion you're trying
426.24s: to give off works best if you show the
427.88s: final scene first and they do that in
429.56s: some movies right they'll show you the
430.76s: outcome before showing you how they got
432.60s: there that's totally okay you can show
434.32s: the last scene first or the first scene
435.84s: last it does not matter so summary don't
437.72s: limit yourself just to chronological
439.48s: order so these are some of the things
440.76s: I've been doing recently that I found
442.28s: have really helped me in creating videos
444.32s: while still keeping up a stacked course
446.28s: load of course take everything I say
447.52s: with a grain of salt because the way I
448.92s: think and the way I create is not going
450.24s: to be how you create and how you think
451.92s: that's because everyone over time will
453.52s: develop their own creative style so the
455.52s: most important thing is that you start
457.16s: you start making videos and that over
458.96s: time you will actually develop your own
460.64s: creative style you'll figure out what
462.12s: you like you'll figure out what you
463.28s: don't like you'll figure out what you're
464.48s: good at and what you want to learn and
465.92s: when you put all that together with
467.12s: yourself as the string tying it all
468.84s: together that right there will be your
470.64s: creative style so to summarize the
472.44s: entire lecture a few final key takeaways
474.84s: number one figure out who you are figure
476.84s: out your story your background and what
478.56s: you're trying to do because once you
479.72s: answer that question it'll be pretty
480.84s: simple to figure out what you want to
482.16s: make and the topics that you want to
483.68s: dive into in your videos number two
485.68s: using the right gear of course having
487.48s: the best gear is great but if you don't
488.84s: know how to use it it's actively harming
490.52s: you third bring your camera with you
492.00s: when you go out film as much as you can
493.72s: because the only way to get better is to
495.24s: film and practice and four do not limit
497.48s: yourself to only telling stories in
499.08s: chronological order play around with it
501.16s: get creative with how you want to slice
502.64s: together your Clips get creative with
503.96s: your transitions b-roll drone shots
506.00s: these are ways that you can actually get
507.08s: into it and start crafting videos that
508.84s: are more like art pieces instead of just
510.84s: video diaries that are just retellings
512.48s: of your day so this has been another
514.04s: overview of how I go about vlogging my
515.96s: life thank you guys so much for watching
517.16s: if you have additional questions drop
518.76s: them below and let's get a discussion
520.08s: going and as well if you guys want to
521.28s: check out the tripod that I use for all
522.76s: my Vlogs when I'm on the go I'll have it
524.64s: linked down in the description thanks
525.88s: for watching and I'll see you guys in
527.04s: the next one
