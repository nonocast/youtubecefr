so one thing that I find a lot of creators face when it comes to sitting down and filming their lives especially beginners is the lack of general direction for myself recently I've been doing a lot more thinking into my own creative process because right now I'm in school I'm in University so it's really more important than ever for me to have my time management down so I can really make time for what I want to do so today that's what I wanted to talk about I wanted to show you guys how I go through and make these videos how I'm able to live my life go through full-time school and hopefully by the end of this video you guys will have a good sense of how I make these videos and implement it into your own videos so what are you supposed to film what are you supposed to say what is the general idea and topic of your videos I found that the easy answer to that question is just film your life bring your camera with you on your day and film whatever you get up to and that does work that's what a lot of videos and Vlogs on this platform are but here's how I try and think of my Vlogs test so I've said this before but I try and think of my videos as a journal a place that I can showcase and talk about what I'm up to in my life life but also how I feel so what that means for me is that these Vlogs are really a place for reflection don't just show me what you're up to in your day tell me how you feel tell me what you did and how that made you feel so me personally I usually don't scrip my videos aside from videos like this where I have very specific talking points I need to hit but I will always ensure that no matter what the video is it has a central topic or theme and that idea can literally be anything it could be a song a feeling a product a trip an emotion I truly think that anything can be turned into a story in the form of a vlog so things that you should think about before you come up with an idea who are you what's your background and what are you trying to do a lot of the time even now I'm going to be honest it feels like I'm going out and just filming Random clips and trying to string them together in the edit but something that I understand now more than I did in the beginning is that even if there is no string to tie your entire video together they're still you the person recording it it's your Vlog so you are that string tying all the clips together so now when I sit down and make these videos I try and lean into that a lot more I try and lean into the emotions that I was feeling when I was out shooting that video and try and really recreate that in the edit just remember that everyone in life is on their own Journey so just try and take your camera your audience on whatever Journey that you're on when I first picked up a camera I did think that the best camera was going to make me the best videographer the best filmmaker the best YouTuber but chances are for all of us if I handed you A10 $220,000 camera right now we both probably wouldn't be able to use it and it would probably actually complicate things so much that we would either give up not have a video or just make a worse quality video than if we just used what we knew how to use it's actually super important that you use the camera the tools that you're familiar with that you're comfortable with that can actually get you from point A to point B your goals so I basically exclusively shoot all of my videos on my Sony a6700 I also have a drone and a 360 camera but those are like Niche cameras for everyday filming talking cinematic stuff this is the angle that you guys see and I pair that with two lenses my 11 mm wide angle for talking and 17 to 70 zoom lens for whenever I need a little bit more reach this is what the entire setup looks like and I use it mainly because the colors and quality is amazing but really it's about the convenience for me this is the camera that I know how to use and it's also compact enough that I actually bring it out with me and it's not intrusive to my daily life but my point right now is that if you want to make videos about your life and carry a camera with you it's going to have to be Compact and small enough and convenient enough that you'll actually use it so when it comes down to actually filming there's really two things that I like to do there's film a roll which is like this where I'm actually talking to you guys and then there's b roll which is just overlaid on top maybe with some music a little slow motion things that help progress the story that aren't just me talking to you guys and this is how I do both to craft my videos so recently I've been using the ulanzi TT 38 tripod and the reason that it's important to have a tripod like this is because when you're out shooting by yourself you're going to have to get a lot of different shots sometimes when you're filming the a roll you'll need to hold the camera in your hand and usually you want to get a little bit of distance between yourself and the camera so you're not just showing your face but also your surroundings so in those cases that's where I use this in handheld mode and then for other shots like right now where you guys are sitting on my desk it's also super important to be able to set up these kind of static shots whether I'm behind the camera or in front of the camera it feels good to know that your camera is secure for myself when it comes to shooting it really is all about convenience and I'll show you what I mean so instead of individually folding out each leg now with one click of a button the entire mechanism unfolds and the same logic applies for the fact that the entire thing is a quick release system so with a quick lock or unlock I can quickly take take off my camera or put it back on so I can get right to shooting anything that I own that can increase my productivity and efficiency when I'm shooting is exactly the kind of thing that you're going to want when you're out shooting your life which if you guys have noticed is kind of the entire theme around this entire video and when I'm all done talking I can literally just pack up and leave so being able to quickly set up these shots and capture exactly what I'm looking for is what this tripod is all about it also has this hook on the back which my last tripod did not but now any overhanging surface can allow me to mount my tripod to it so now I've got angles like ah pretty cool stuff super important to have the right tool that actually contributes without taking away and over complicating your process so if you want to check out the TT 38 tripod I'll have it linked in the description because of my creative style and the type of videos that I like to make I really just find that I need to film a lot I'll definitely remind myself to try and capture shots in between scenes and once or twice a week I'll go out and maybe shoot the sunset or shoot the park or just general establishing shots I would much rather capture too much footage than not have enough to tell the story and I think what's helped me a lot is just consciously remembering to bring my camera because the worst feeling is really going out not having your camera and thinking to yourself how nice it would have been to capture that moment so after a day a week or a few days of shooting when I get home the first thing I do is dump all that footage onto my computer and just like anything else in this entire creative process editing is also incredibly subjective the way I do things does not have to be how you go do things and also I can tell you right now the way I do things is definitely not the scientifically proven correct way to do things in the past I've already made a video about color grading but I definitely want to update that soon but for this section right now I'm not going to dive into technical details I'm more just going to talk about how I think about organizing my footage and chopping it up instead of the actual sliders and tools and things and buttons I'm clicking so when it comes to chopping up a video a lot of times people will do the simple thing which is just chop from chronological order morning to night time and that totally works I personally found myself experimenting with kind of placing together footage as scenes as I call them uh in different orders and these scenes are any like period of time where I'm picking up the camera let's say in one of my previous videos I go to an ultimate frisbee game and I film that that would be one scene me getting ready changed and walking to the field would probably be the start of the scene and the game end or walking home would probably be the end of the scene and then there'd be some sort of transition maybe I would use some sort of b-roll that I was talking about earlier so once I've gone through and chopped up all of my original raw footage and yes I do actually look at all of my original footage every second of it once I have that set in front of me I will go and take the scenes and move them around and create the best story that I can if whatever theme or emotion you're trying to give off works best if you show the final scene first and they do that in some movies right they'll show you the outcome before showing you how they got there that's totally okay you can show the last scene first or the first scene last it does not matter so summary don't limit yourself just to chronological order so these are some of the things I've been doing recently that I found have really helped me in creating videos while still keeping up a stacked course load of course take everything I say with a grain of salt because the way I think and the way I create is not going to be how you create and how you think that's because everyone over time will develop their own creative style so the most important thing is that you start you start making videos and that over time you will actually develop your own creative style you'll figure out what you like you'll figure out what you don't like you'll figure out what you're good at and what you want to learn and when you put all that together with yourself as the string tying it all together that right there will be your creative style so to summarize the entire lecture a few final key takeaways number one figure out who you are figure out your story your background and what you're trying to do because once you answer that question it'll be pretty simple to figure out what you want to make and the topics that you want to dive into in your videos number two using the right gear of course having the best gear is great but if you don't know how to use it it's actively harming you third bring your camera with you when you go out film as much as you can because the only way to get better is to film and practice and four do not limit yourself to only telling stories in chronological order play around with it get creative with how you want to slice together your Clips get creative with your transitions b-roll drone shots these are ways that you can actually get into it and start crafting videos that are more like art pieces instead of just video diaries that are just retellings of your day so this has been another overview of how I go about vlogging my life thank you guys so much for watching if you have additional questions drop them below and let's get a discussion going and as well if you guys want to check out the tripod that I use for all my Vlogs when I'm on the go I'll have it linked down in the description thanks for watching and I'll see you guys in the next one h
