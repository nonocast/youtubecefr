10.48s: Good morning, guys. Welcome back, guys.
13.36s: I don't want you to think I've forgotten
14.96s: about the Alone But Not Lonely series
16.72s: because I've done these videos. I think
18.64s: I've had the series for almost a year
20.48s: now, which is kind of crazy and I love
22.32s: them. I think they're so fun. You guys
24.00s: also seem to love them. Today is Friday,
25.76s: but I'm kind of treating it like my
27.28s: weekend. Usually for these videos, I
29.52s: have some structure. Like I know in
31.20s: advance kind of what I want to do. But
33.12s: to be honest, I have no idea what I'm
35.44s: going to do today. I just know I want it
36.96s: to be a nice day. Like I want to just do
38.96s: the little things. Get coffee. I might
40.32s: want to bike on the highway and just
42.88s: spend some time by myself in like the
45.04s: best way possible. So I guess we'll see.
46.96s: I kind of like that not knowing a
48.40s: little. Actually, I don't I'm so type A
50.40s: that I like hate not knowing things. So
52.40s: I'm editing this right now and I just
53.92s: want to say one thing. Well, actually
56.24s: two things. One thing, I'm sorry. I'm
58.40s: sorry I missed a week of uploading. Um,
61.52s: the reason is I was in Alaska, which was
64.24s: so fun. I saw Bears and United and Italy
67.60s: Coffee were so nice to send me there.
69.92s: So, thank you to them. That was like so
71.44s: fun. That's the update as to why I
73.44s: didn't post for a week.
76.32s: Don't hate me. The first thing that
78.24s: makes me happy, as you guys know, is
80.64s: getting coffee. So, we're going to do
81.92s: that really quick. I promise we will do
84.00s: other fun things.
91.49s: [Applause]
92.14s: [Music]
96.96s: Okay, guys. I got my coffee. I did get
99.44s: busted for filming. I walked in there
101.84s: and the guy working there was like, "No
103.28s: filming. No filming." That is like what
105.12s: feeds my fear of filming the most is
107.12s: because I'm I would say I'm like a rule
108.80s: follower and I hate like breaking rules
111.20s: and some places like don't let you film
112.72s: but you don't really know until you're
114.40s: in there. Usually that doesn't happen
115.92s: though. That hasn't happened to me
116.96s: honestly in a long time. Anyways, I did
119.44s: get my coffee. It's amazing. It's called
121.44s: Stump Town and I got an iced vanilla
124.00s: latte with skim milk. And then I also
126.00s: got kind of an impulsive purchase. A
128.00s: lemon poppy seed muffin. I'm hungry. I
130.96s: didn't eat yet. So that is why I decided
134.08s: to get this. See if it's good. Here it
137.28s: is.
140.64s: I don't even like lemon poppy seeds. I
142.72s: don't know why I bought this. If I have
143.84s: a free day in the summer, I like to come
145.92s: to this park. There's so much people
147.76s: watching here. It's one of my favorite
149.20s: things to do, especially when I'm by
150.48s: myself, is just observe the people
152.24s: around me. I like to like watch people
154.16s: watch how people interact, see different
156.08s: outfits. I don't know. It's really
157.60s: entertaining. So, I'm going to do that.
158.96s: But I'm also going to read. I brought a
161.28s: book that I got actually quite a while
163.04s: ago. I got this book six months ago.
165.28s: It's kind of a funny story actually. My
166.96s: boyfriend and I decided to get the same
168.64s: book together and it was like really
169.92s: cute. We went to this bookstore. We
171.52s: picked out the same book together
173.04s: because we wanted to have our own little
174.96s: mini book club for two people. And then
177.76s: um it never happened because we both
179.84s: like never started the book. And I
182.08s: honestly feel like we both like I feel
183.52s: like he forgot about it too. I was like,
185.20s: "Oh, I should read this book. It's been
187.20s: sitting here. I'm gonna read this and
188.80s: enjoy my coffee.
192.82s: [Music]
218.32s: Okay, guys. So, after the park, I ended
220.32s: up walking around. I had to pick up a
222.00s: gift card for my friend. And I walked by
224.96s: the market, and I didn't know it was
226.56s: open today. I've been here a couple
227.92s: times before, I think, in a vlog,
229.68s: actually. It's so cute. They have tons
231.20s: of fresh fruit and veggies and eggs.
233.36s: But, I think I want to get some flowers
235.12s: here. I don't know which flowers to get.
237.68s: There's so many. It is so hot, you guys.
241.44s: Holy crap. Like, I am sweating so much
244.00s: right now. I kind of want to get
246.08s: asparagus. I don't know why. It sounds
248.16s: really good. Maybe I can make a dinner
249.52s: with asparagus tonight.
255.37s: [Music]
262.40s: [Music]
273.76s: I just got back. It is so hot out. I
276.48s: think I got scalp sunburn. I could feel
279.20s: my scalp burning when I was outside. But
282.40s: I am inside taking a break in the AC.
285.44s: And I'm going to put my flowers that I
288.08s: got in a vase. I've been loving getting
290.40s: fresh flowers recently. It's something
292.96s: that I actually used to not like, which
294.96s: I think is so interesting. I used to
296.40s: kind of be a hater of flowers because I
298.64s: was like, it's so pointless. They die
300.16s: anyways. What's the point of getting and
302.40s: like buying flowers for myself? And then
304.24s: once I started getting them, I realized
306.24s: how just beautiful and like happy they
307.92s: make me even though they don't last. And
309.76s: I've also found ways to make them last
311.36s: longer. I just like try to refresh the
312.96s: water all the time. They like make my
314.72s: week. So, I like to do it for myself. I
317.20s: never used to have a favorite flower
318.48s: either. And now my favorite are
320.64s: definitely liies. Is this what getting
322.40s: older is like? I feel like yes. I'm
324.64s: going to put them in a vase with some
326.56s: fresh water.
329.12s: [Music]
330.25s: [Applause]
334.66s: [Music]
342.72s: And there they are. They are so
344.48s: beautiful. I love the color of these
346.00s: ones. And it makes me so happy. I can't
348.00s: even tell you how happy fresh flowers
350.00s: make me. Anyways, today's been such a
352.08s: nice, beautiful day. I feel like I've
353.92s: been so spoiled today just doing like
355.76s: all of my favorite things. Oh my god,
358.48s: guys. I got something on my shirt from
360.64s: the flowers. Do you see that? I actually
363.12s: came home and there was all of this
365.52s: brown dust on my face from the flowers.
368.48s: And I felt so embarrassed that I was
370.00s: walking around and everyone was probably
371.44s: looking at me like, "Why does she have
372.56s: dirt all over her face?" I don't know
374.16s: how that happened. But anyways, I think
377.12s: I'm going to chill here for just a
378.72s: little bit. Then I don't know, maybe
380.72s: I'll go on a bike ride later. Kind of
382.32s: want ice cream, too. I have no plan for
384.32s: today, as you know. So, I guess we'll
385.76s: see. Give me a few minutes and I don't
387.28s: know what to think about it. Okay, guys.
389.20s: So, I'm by the Westside Highway right
391.20s: now because I'm going to go bike. I
393.52s: really want to just have a leisurely
395.12s: bike ride. And I also want to get ice
397.20s: cream, but I'm seeing this ice cream
399.20s: truck and I really want to get ice cream
401.28s: with chocolate sprinkles.
406.72s: Hi. Can I be in the video? Sure. Hi.
409.76s: Welcome to New York. Hi. Hi. Can I have
413.12s: um a vanilla ice cream cone with
414.72s: chocolate sprinkles? Bye. Bye. Bye.
418.80s: Wait, you guys do combo? Yeah. You want
420.88s: vanilla chocolate? You want that one? I
422.80s: just didn't know you did that. Whatever
424.32s: you want, honey. Uh I'll just do
426.56s: chocolate. Okay, guys. I got my ice
428.16s: cream. It is about to fall off with
430.08s: chocolate sprinkles. It's so cute. Look
432.24s: at it. So cute. Oh my gosh,
436.00s: it's falling. Oh my gosh, it's flying.
438.48s: This is stressful to eat. It's making a
440.56s: mess. This ice cream's like warm. It's
442.40s: melting. This reminds me of when I was
444.16s: younger. I so badly wanted there to be
446.88s: an ice cream truck that would come
448.00s: through my neighborhood because we
449.68s: didn't have one. I don't know, like they
451.52s: never came through in my neighborhood
452.80s: for some reason. And I so badly like
455.12s: fantasized about having an ice cream
457.20s: truck that I called the ice cream truck
459.28s: company when I was like 10 and I asked
461.36s: them if they would reroute to like go
463.60s: through my street and they did and they
465.76s: ended up coming for years. So it worked.
468.80s: Seeing these trucks just like reminds me
470.56s: of that. But ice cream with the
472.24s: chocolate sprinkles is the best. If you
474.16s: guys haven't had chocolate sprinkles
475.52s: before, like I don't know why more
477.28s: people aren't on them. They're so good.
479.28s: I call them jimmies, but they're so much
481.68s: better than regular sprinkles. Making a
483.92s: mess. Oh my god, I'm making a mess. I
486.40s: like cannot even eat this, guys. They're
488.08s: so melted. My hands are so sticky. It's
490.96s: the best ice cream. I know that sounds
492.48s: very strange, but in my opinion, their
494.48s: ice cream is like the best in New York.
496.32s: Those ice cream trucks always hit.
498.40s: Always. I'm going to go biking now on
500.08s: the Westside Highway. I like to electric
502.56s: way because I'm lazy. So, that is what
505.44s: I'm going to do. I'm going to try to see
506.48s: if they have any city bikes around where
508.32s: I could just rent one click on my phone.
510.64s: On the West Side Highway, they have a
512.16s: little section where you can bike and
513.68s: it's just perfect.
515.80s: [Music]
522.32s: It's a sad day for me because all the
524.40s: electric bikes are for some reason out
526.48s: of order. So, I am doing a manual bike
529.92s: and I'm not loving it, but it's fine.
532.80s: Maybe this is good for me. But this is
534.56s: the Westside Highway. It's beautiful. If
536.96s: you've been to New York or you live
538.24s: here, you know this is like just such a
540.24s: beautiful spot where people run and
542.32s: walk. I like to go on walks here and
544.40s: I've been riding a little bit recently,
546.16s: which is a little bit out of character
547.44s: for me, but when I do, I love to run
549.84s: just on this Westside Highway right
551.68s: here. But they have a little bike path
553.76s: right up here that just streams right
556.72s: along the highway. So guys, am I going
558.56s: to be able to vlog and do this? I don't
560.08s: know. I don't know if I'm that um
561.84s: coordinated. famous last words. Okay.
564.32s: Okay. Me going 2 miles an hour.
566.48s: Definitely more work with the regular
568.16s: bike and not the electric. Hey, look.
570.96s: People are playing tennis.
574.40s: Biking with a skirt on is a crazy move.
576.88s: I don't know why I decided to do that.
579.28s: Imagine I'm filming that and I just wipe
580.96s: out. That would happen is the thing.
587.98s: [Music]
596.88s: We're continuing with the iPhone vlog
598.88s: all of a sudden. I ended up at Trader
601.04s: Joe's. I needed some things grocery
603.92s: wise, obviously. So, I grabbed a few
607.04s: things in my cart and then I'm going to
608.56s: go back. That's the update.
611.42s: [Music]
616.40s: Okay, guys. I just got back from Trader
618.16s: Joe's. That bike ride ended up being so
621.04s: long because I couldn't find a spot to
623.60s: dock it at the end. If you've ever done
625.36s: city bikes, you would know that you
627.44s: basically like when you rent the bike,
628.88s: you get it from this dock and they have
630.80s: different docks around the city. And if
632.88s: you go to put it back and they're all
634.48s: filled, you have nowhere to put it. I
636.48s: was just like biking around trying to
638.24s: find a place to discard my bike.
640.24s: Anyways, then I went to Trader Joe's
641.76s: really quickly because I just needed a
643.20s: few groceries. This is kind of gross,
646.00s: but I do live alone and it's a perk of
648.08s: living alone. I drank the milk just out
650.16s: of the carton. I used to not drink
652.00s: normal milk. I went through I would say
653.76s: 5 years I was drinking oat milk or
655.36s: almond milk and then I started drinking
656.96s: regular milk again as you guys know and
659.28s: I like it. It doesn't like break me out
660.80s: or anything. So, I actually prefer it.
662.80s: And then I got some other random things
664.80s: like some granola that I also started
667.20s: snacking on. Some parmesan cheese.
670.16s: Forgot to mention earlier when I was at
671.68s: the farmers market, I got some
673.44s: broccolini. I saw it and it called my
676.32s: name. So I got stuff to make the
677.84s: broccolini probably tomorrow for my
679.76s: lunch. I saw a recipe on Tik Tok when I
681.92s: was at Trader Joe's and it involved
684.00s: onions, some garlic, of course, two
688.24s: short cuts, pre-peled garlic, and pre-
691.20s: chopped onions. I'm a lazy chef. We know
694.08s: this. But I like to take my shortcuts
695.76s: when I cook. I also got some
696.96s: strawberries cuz I needed them. Some
699.12s: pretzels. Also started eating these.
701.04s: Wow. I came home and I just started
703.12s: feasting. I got some Impossible nuggets.
705.92s: These are so good. Oh, and then I got
708.56s: some pomegranate seeds and then banana,
711.52s: two of them, and a lemon. So that's
714.40s: everything that I got. A little quick
716.32s: fast grocery haul. So that's the video.
719.04s: Again, this was, you know, I need to
721.60s: work on things because why did I not do
723.68s: an outro? I actually do know why. I
725.76s: ended up just watching a show after this
727.28s: and I went to bed and I like totally
728.56s: forgot to film, but I didn't do
730.32s: anything. So, we didn't miss out. But, I
733.04s: just want to say I love you guys. Thanks
734.72s: so much for watching and I promise I'll
736.64s: see you next week in my next vlog. Bye.
742.46s: [Music]
