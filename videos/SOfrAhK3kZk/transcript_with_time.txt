0.78s: - If you've never liked
the 24-105 lens from Canon,
4.89s: well, I got news from you.
6.12s: The RF version is a
lot better than the EF.
9.18s: I'm gonna give you my review
10.38s: of the 24-105 Canon RF f/1.4, 1.4?
15.54s: I wish it was 1.4.
16.86s: Oh my God, that'd be a dream lens.
18.21s: f/4.0 lens.
21.09s: Check it out.
21.92s: So, this is the RF mount lens.
25.47s: This will only work on your RF cameras.
27.54s: So, if you have a 80D, if you have a M50,
31.68s: anything like that,
32.88s: it won't work on.
33.71s: So, you have to have an R5,
an R6, EOS R, R6 Mark II,
39.33s: maybe if you're lucky
enough to have an R3,
40.97s: it'll work on your R3,
42.33s: or even, say, a C70.
44.25s: I was not a fan of pretty
much all the other 24-105s.
49.26s: They just felt a little,
51.78s: I don't know, it's not my favorite,
54.06s: I mean, you get a lot, right?
55.23s: You get 24-105 focal length.
57.84s: So, you can go wide angle
59.55s: and you can go, you know,
relatively telephoto.
62.73s: But the f/4.0 always sort of took me away.
64.56s: It felt like you'd lose the light,
67.50s: you know, with the f/4.0
69.24s: and I didn't think it was that sharp.
72.39s: This lens changed my mind on that.
75.30s: It's crazy sharp,
77.43s: and especially with
the mirrorless cameras,
79.08s: I don't really notice the
loss of light as much.
81.66s: So, I actually prefer this the
most for studio photography,
84.72s: although I use it on
a lot of other things.
86.91s: You can see here it's got a
54-millimeter diameter in back
90.39s: and the front is a 77-millimeter,
93.21s: so, yeah, for your filter size in front.
97.35s: I have an R5 here.
98.91s: You can see it's a nice compact lens.
101.16s: I mean, it's not tiny,
102.81s: but it's not massive compared
to some other lenses.
106.80s: And this is definitely a great choice
108.60s: if you're not sure what
lens to start with.
111.90s: It's relatively affordable,
113.34s: you know, in regards to an L lens
116.28s: and you get just a lot
of bang for your buck
118.56s: in the sense of everything from 24,
121.65s: I mean, 24-105 can pretty much cover
124.68s: whatever you need to do.
126.24s: For travel photography,
it's gonna be great.
129.54s: And again, I like it
for studio photography.
131.67s: It's one of my favorite
lenses for studio photography.
135.45s: Not much to the lens.
136.62s: You have a lock.
137.64s: This lock right here will lock this.
140.34s: So, if you are traveling or moving around.
142.26s: If you unlock it, then
the front extends out.
145.80s: And so obviously the lock will only engage
149.61s: when it's fully brought back.
153.12s: And then you have, you have your,
156.57s: let me unlock it, there
you go, so you can extend.
158.58s: This is to adjust the focal length.
160.74s: This is to adjust focus,
162.30s: but more than likely, you're
probably using autofocus,
165.33s: especially if you're on
an RF lens, or RF body.
169.95s: And this is the control ring.
172.05s: This is where,
173.67s: all the RF lenses have this,
175.14s: well, I believe they all do,
especially all the L ones.
178.23s: And you could assign this
to, it's programmable.
180.27s: So, you could have it be
your ISO, your shutter.
182.82s: I like it to be my aperture,
184.47s: but oftentimes I do hit it on accident.
187.08s: So, if I know I don't really
want it as my aperture,
189.84s: I will just actually not set this.
191.22s: So, this doesn't do anything for me.
192.87s: But that's just my own personal choice.
194.76s: So, yeah, this is a,
197.78s: if you were like, "You know what?
199.14s: I really did not like the 24-105 EF,"
203.46s: you'll probably like this one.
204.60s: Also, just so you have,
205.47s: over here, you have just
a switch for autofocus,
208.05s: or AF stands for autofocus.
210.09s: MF stands for manual focus.
212.94s: And then, oh, the favorite part
about this, it's stabilized.
216.09s: So, if you don't know
what stabilization means,
218.52s: essentially, there's elements inside
221.46s: that will stabilize it.
222.36s: So, if you're handheld
shooting photography,
225.84s: you can shoot at a lower shutter speed,
228.09s: or if you're shooting video,
229.29s: you can actually literally
go handheld with this.
231.39s: Especially if you have
in-body stabilization,
233.58s: like your R5, R6,
235.47s: pretty much every camera
except the EOS R and the,
241.08s: there's one other one
that doesn't have it.
242.70s: But you could shoot handheld
244.59s: with in-body stabilization on the camera
246.57s: and IS on the lens.
249.06s: It's a fantastic combo.
250.32s: So, this lens does get my two thumbs up.
253.47s: I think you'll thoroughly enjoy it.
255.72s: Just know it's an f/4.0.
257.19s: So, you're not gonna,
258.02s: it's not gonna give you a
super shallow depth of field,
261.57s: but I think it makes
up for it with the cost
264.84s: and the focal range that you get.
266.88s: All right, enjoy.
268.79s: (upbeat music)
