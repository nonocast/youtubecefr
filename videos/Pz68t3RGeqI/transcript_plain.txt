Starbucks they came out with their new fall drinks yesterday I just have to go and then I have a few things I need to get down on my to-do list that I'm going to take you guys along with me it's a sunny day and sunny day just honestly make my mood 10 times better I'm one of those people that the weather really affects my mood look how nice it looks out today so Sunny my brother has some friends coming over later today so he set up a couple games for them this is one of my first times using the glow drops by drunk elephant and I actually love them I don't really know exactly what the day holds but it's more fun that way okay my makeup is done it's definitely very glowy today but now I'm going to pick out my fit for today I don't know what to wear I think some color could be fun otherwise I could wear the skims bodysuit but I kind of want to wear a little bit more color today I tend to gravitate toward more neutral colors when I dress I've been trying to like be more fun okay I've been trying to have more color in my wardrobe so yeah I'm going to wear this for today and then I'm wearing these pants these I got from aritzia when I was in New York if you watched that Vlog for jewelry I'm going to throw on a few rings today I'm going to throw on this one I wear everyday and then this heart one that I just got then this other heart one from Brandy okay guys should I wear these heart earrings or my gold hoops I just feel like I always wear hoops and I want to switch it up but I honestly can't they are staple for a reason getting ready just makes me feel better I honestly don't even really need to get ready I just enjoy getting ready for my day it really kind of like gives me a bit of a routine and just keeps me motivated o before I go you guys I just got these new shoes I love them I was on the wait list for so long so these are the SAS by Adidas I'm at Starbucks you guys know I usually get the same thing the strawberry refresher but yesterday I came here because the fall drinks came out and I had the pumpkin shy and it was so so good I feel like I'm just going to be drinking that on rotation now I just get obsessed with the drink for a while I let it run its course then once I'm sick of it I replace it with something else I also have been trying to see this one girl here I think her name is Drew she watches my videos so hi if you're watching this and she's so sweet she's always working at the drive-thru I just like her so much and I get so much PR so if she's working which I hope she is I wanted to just give her some of these things there's some foundations some skin care and this super super cute Sally Hansen nail polish kit I think I'm going to try to throw in this bag because I feel like that will be easier like is this allowed or like well I hope she doesn't get in trouble I came here yesterday she wasn't here so I'm just like hoping hoping she's here how can I get started for you hi can I have the grande iced pumpkin chai please okay 6:37 thank you okay I can't tell if this is her like I couldn't tell it was her voice Hi how are you good how are you good do you want PR like I B some you yeah are you

sweet girl but this is the pumpkin chai and it's so good you guys need to try this if you haven't okay I decided to stop at Target really quick since I got my nails taken off I want to at least paint them I haven't painted my nails in so long like I can't remember the last time I got nail polish and painted them so I'm going to see if I can find a cute color I think I'm going to get this one I've been seeing this like on my social media it's by OPI it's in the shade mod about you and I feel like it's just like the perfect ballet pink color there was only one left so that means it was a sign the best thing Target's ever done was get an Ulta put in I feel like I spend so much money here so I'm home now so my brother decided to have like some of his friends over and they're having this basketball tournament hi hi my mom's so cute she set this up for them a little snack area which is where I will be you guys joining me for the food yeah you know I'm in charge of the music bye all right I think it's time to paint my nails when I was at Target by the way I also grabbed this this is a Sally Hansen nail fortifier this is lifechanging if you have Bridal Nails especially like whenever I get my acrylics taken off my nails are really weak I just put a couple coats of this on and my nails are just less likely to break this way but I'm so excited to paint my own Nails I cannot remember the last time that I did my own fingernail painting this color is just the perfect ballerina pink so oh God I'm actually like I'm probably going to be really bad I kind of like the smell of nail polish do you guys also relate or no I think it smells so good it's kind of like when people like the smell of gasoline or chlorine in a pool so oh so I did have to have my mom help me I was just struggling severely and then I remembered I live with my mom right now so she was really sweet and she helped me make them look less horrible can you tell which hand I did and she did comment down below which hand did I do and which hand did she do what's next on my list ooh I think I'm going to throw in some laundry actually the pile is overflowing so I am the worst with gifts you know I'm going to rephrase that I'm actually pretty good I get them in advance I try to be pretty thoughtful but this time I messed up I got gifts for two of my best friends they were my roommates last year and we graduated in May and I was going to give these to them and then they just didn't come in time they actually got like held up at the post office and stuff so it wasn't really my fault I just want to show you guys these cuz they're so precious I got them on Etsy and I'm going to go mail them really quick but before I package them up I just need to show you guys so there's three of us and I got three different heart necklaces so you can see the heart is filled in a different spot for each of them let me go do this before anything else um I'm about to go mail something for Maya and Ash do you have their address I don't want to ask them the way it's literally the gr gift I got them in May honestly I respect that okay I got their address from one of their moms so now I can actually mail these look at me okay I was driving up and I saw this box and I'm pretty sure it's PR It's Too Faced That's so exciting we're going to open this together PR time I'm with Rosie PR is honestly like the most amazing thing I remember when I was like 14 and I was just starting YouTube how much I wanted a box of PR like I just thought it was the coolest thing still to this day when I get PR I get so excited Too Faced is so cute I love their products Cloud Crush wow that looks so pretty and the packaging 10 out of 10 oh actually I did get a package yesterday a different one let me just do a little PR haul quick okay so I have two other packages this first one I'm pretty sure is from colourpop ooh wow they sent a lot of fun things there's some lip stuff which you know is the first thing I always open it's like Christmas every day the they sent some other lip glosses this blush stick I am so happy they sent me this this is a facial mist and I've been wanting to try more like face sprays okay that's enough pop beauty also sent me something they sent some shadows and some blushes a little lip plumper a little hair tie thing that was so fun thank you to those brands that sent me everything I'm going to make some dinner now okay update I made the salad and I made my mom one too and then she picked up some chicken soup for us the reason this soup is so good is because the noodles are so like doughy and I love doughy pasta so if you watched my videos recently you would know I'm kind of in a bath routine I love I just love taking baths I'm going to complete my routine oh I didn't mean
